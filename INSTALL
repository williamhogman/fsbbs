To install fsbbs you first need to install its dependencies

$ pip install cyclone jinja2 markdown msgpack twisted zope.interface txtwistedapi

you then need to install redis which you can  find in your package manager

for now we need to setup the basic database structure manually
$ redis-cli

> set thing:1:type forum
> set thing:1:name "My Forum"
> set thing:1:tagline "My tagline"

Lets make a category too
> set thing:2:type category
> set thing:2:title "General"
the description may use markdown
> set thing:2:description "Discuss something here"

Exit out of the redis console.

Now it is time to launch fsbbs

cd to the root directory of the source tree and run:
$ python2 -m fsbbs

the default port is 3037 so go ahead and browse there
